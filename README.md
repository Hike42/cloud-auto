# Welcome to Cloud-Auto!

Hi!
This project was carried out as part of a course at Hetic to learn how to use Google's Firebase tools (cloud solution). Cloud Auto takes the form of an ecommerce site (on the theme of cars in this situation) with different user roles, all secure and protected.

# Production ENV

To take the challenge a step further, I decided to deploy the project. Everything is **online!** and available here : [Production](https://master--cloud-auto.netlify.app/)
